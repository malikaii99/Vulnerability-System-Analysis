# Vulnerability System Analysis
<h1>Description</h1>

In this task, I will perform a vulnerability assessment for a small business, where I will assess the potential risks associated with a susceptible information system and create a plan for addressing and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

A vulnerability assessment is an internal examination of an organization's security systems. As a cybersecurity analyst, I may be involved in conducting vulnerability assessments to proactively safeguard the organization against potential security threats.


<h2>Scenario</h2>

Review the scenario below.

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.


<h2>Vulnerability Assessment Report; October 5th, 2023 </h2>

<h3>System Description </h3>

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.


<h3>Scope </h3>

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.


<h3>Purpose</h3>

The server plays a pivotal role in the day-to-day operations of the business, serving as the platform for our essential operating system that numerous employees rely on. Should this server become disabled, the integrity of our digital security system would be jeopardized, consequently impacting various facets of our operations. This impairment would have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only our technical infrastructure but also our managerial processes. As such, the server's uninterrupted functionality is critical for maintaining the overall efficiency and security of the business


<h3> Risk Assessment </h3>
<h4> Threat source--->Threat event--->Likelihood--->Severity--->Risk</h4>

Malicious Software--->Affect operational security control--->2--->3--->6
Operating Systems--->Linux OS  will be compromised--->3--->3--->9
Hacker--->Obtain sensitive information--->3--->3--->9


<h3> Approach </h3>

Within the context of the business' software and management processes, a thorough and methodical evaluation of risks takes place. This comprehensive assessment entails gauging the likelihood of various threats materializing and quantifying the potential ramifications these events may have on the organization's day-to-day operational necessities. This meticulous risk evaluation not only allows the business to proactively identify vulnerabilities but also enables the implementation of targeted mitigation strategies to bolster security measures. By continually monitoring and reassessing these risks, the business can adapt and refine its security protocols to ensure ongoing protection against potential threats, safeguarding its operations and data in an ever-evolving digital landscape. This proactive approach fosters resilience and ensures that the organization remains well-prepared to address emerging challenges in the realm of cybersecurity.


<h3> Remediation Strategy </h3>

The meticulous safeguarding of the database server involves the careful implementation of a comprehensive array of security measures. Firstly, a robust authentication system is put in place to verify and authenticate users, ensuring that only those who are authorized gain access. This involves the establishment of stringent password policies that mandate the use of strong, complex passwords. Additionally, role-based access controls are deployed, delineating specific access permissions based on job roles, and multi-factor authentication is employed, adding an extra layer of security to verify user identities.

Furthermore, to fortify the protection of data during transmission, the implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is prioritized over the less secure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLS ensures that data moving between the database server and connected clients remains encrypted and secure, shielding it from potential eavesdropping or interception.

In addition to these measures, IP allow-listing is implemented to restrict access to the database server only to recognized corporate office locations. This strategic approach prevents random and potentially malicious internet users from connecting to the database, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

Collectively, these meticulous security measures form a multi-layered defense strategy, aiming to fortify the database server against a range of potential threats and vulnerabilities, ultimately ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data assets.
